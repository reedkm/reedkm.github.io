	<p>
		My name is Kenneth Reed, and I am originally from New Jerseyâ€”though I have lived in multiple states such as North Carolina and California, as well as overseas in Okinawa, Japan. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I studied Philosophy as an undergrad, and Library Science in grad school. I've worked in academic publishing for many years.
